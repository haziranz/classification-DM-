this this the sourch codes for Assignment on Classification.
Q
You are required to build three different classifiers for this prediction task and
compare their results. The three classifiers should include a Decision tree-based
classifier (E.g., J48, ID3), a Rule-based classifier(E.g., FOIL [1], CPAR [2]) and a
Bayesian classifier (E.g., Naive Bayes, Bayesian Nets). You may use implementations
from Machine learning libraries such as WEKA.
